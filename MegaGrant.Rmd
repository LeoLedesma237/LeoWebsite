This document serves to track data cleaning for MegaGrant data. For context, this was a study that took place in Russia that investigated how rearing in an institutionalized environment reflected behaviorally and neurophysiolologically in adulthood. Several different measures were collected from participants including: demographic information, medical records, IQ, executive function, quality of life, delinquency, language abilities, and EEG data. 

For my master's thesis, I am curious to investigate if language related measures are associated with neurophysiological measures, specifically with power of certain frequency bands in resting-state EEG (rsEEG).
