This document serves to track data cleaning for MegaGrant data. For context, this was a study that took place in Russia that investigated how rearing in an institutionalized environment reflected behaviorally and neurophysiolologically in adulthood. Several different measures were collected from participants including: demographic information, medical records, IQ, executive function, quality of life, delinquency, language abilities, and EEG data. 

For my master's thesis, I am curious to investigate if language related measures are associated with neurophysiological measures, specifically with power of certain frequency bands in resting-state EEG (rsEEG). 


### Data Cleaning

**Step 1**: The Master Excel sheet that contained all of the ID's from the study and the data that was associated to it needed to be cleaned. After cleaning the final likely ID number for this study is 700. [[Click here to view script]](https://leoledesma237.github.io/LeoWebsite/MegaGrant.Scripts/ID.Cleaning.html) 

**Step 2**: Now that we know our sample size, we need to investigate how many subjects contain data for the variables we are interested. Our predictor will be spelling capabilities (ARFA) and the our outcome is rsEEG. Additionally, we want to control for Sex, Age, Group, and IQ. From our 700 ID's, 602 have these data present.

**Step 3**: As mentioned in step 2, even though we identified our ideal N for our analysis, this would only be possible if all rsEEG recordings had no issues throughout the preprocessing pipeline. From our initial 602 rsEEG files, 465 made it through the preprocessing stage. [[Click  here to view script]](https://leoledesma237.github.io/LeoWebsite/MegaGrant.Scripts/Verify.rsEEG.html)

**Step 4**: Fast Fourier transform.
