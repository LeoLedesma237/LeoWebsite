# **Welcome**

Hello! My name is Leandro Ledesma and I am a 2nd year PhD student at the University of Houston. Welcome to my website! The purpose of this site is to manage my scripts that clean, preprocess, and analyze current and previous projects. Please feel free to explore the tabs above for further information. Additionally, RMarkdown scripts will be provided below that will walk you through different statistical approaches that are commonly used in behavioral research. Use them as templates for your own studies. 


### Statistical Approaches

1) **Correlation**: The degree of the relationship between two numeric variables. [[Click here to learn more]](https://leoledesma237.github.io/LeoWebsite/Correlation.Scripts/Correlation.Overview.html)

2) **Regression**: A regression is similar to a correlation except we are using an equation that tells not only how related two or more variables are to each other but may allow for the prediction of an outcome by the value of a predictor variable.
